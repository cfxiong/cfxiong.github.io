The Transportation Engineering Lab also conducts leading-edge transportation big-data research. The Lab hosts, ingests, fuses, and integrates terabytes of location-based service data records and trajectories on a daily basis and producing/visualizing nation-wide and international human mobility and travel behavior patterns to support various multidisciplinary collaborative research efforts including transportation economics, built environment, pandemic monitoring and prediction, and mobility and health. The data platform employs big-data infrastructure programed in PySpark and Hadoop to efficiently impute individual level activities and mobility. This data and related codes and programs will be fully leveraged by the proposed IHBEM project
