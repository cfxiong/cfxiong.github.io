# Villanova Summer Research Internship (VSRI)

The **Villanova Summer Research Internship (VSRI)** is now accepting applications for its **fourth consecutive year**. We warmly invite **motivated high school and undergraduate students** to apply for immersive, hands-on research experiences across a range of interdisciplinary topics.

## 🔬 Research Areas

### 1. Human Mobility Behavior and Climate Change  
**Funded by the National Institutes of Health**, this project investigates how climatic events and extreme weather influence human activities, travel behavior, and mobility patterns.

### 2. Transportation and Health Research  
In collaboration with the **Institute of Human Virology (IHV)**, this ongoing study analyzes multimodal long-distance travel (air, rail, car, etc.) and reconstructs spatial-temporal disease dynamics using human activity and trajectory data.

### 3. Electric Vehicle Market Study  
This seed project examines adoption trends and hesitancy in **mature and emerging EV markets**, focusing on Norway, Sweden, and the U.S., using market data, registration records, and empirical insights.

### 4. Carbon Credits and Carbon Neutralization  
**Funded by the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)**, this project explores innovative financing systems based on tradable carbon and equity credits. Travelers who shift to sustainable modes earn credits that can be purchased by others to meet carbon goals.
