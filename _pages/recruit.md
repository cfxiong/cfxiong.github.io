# Villanova Summer Research Internship (VSRI)

The **Villanova Summer Research Internship (VSRI)** Program is now accepting applications for its **fourth consecutive year**. We warmly invite **dedicated high school and undergraduate students** to apply for hands-on research opportunities in the following interdisciplinary areas:

## 🔬 Research Areas

### 1. Human Mobility Behavior and Climate Change  
**Funded by the National Institutes of Health**, this project investigates how climatic events and extreme weather influence human activities, travel behavior, and mobility patterns.

### 2. Transportation and Health Research  
In collaboration with the **Institute of Human Virology (IHV)**, this ongoing research explores multimodal international and long-distance travel (air, rail, car, etc.) and reconstructs spatial-temporal disease dynamics using human activity and trajectory data.

### 3. Electric Vehicle Market Study  
This seed project examines adoption tendencies and hesitancy in **mature and emerging EV markets**, focusing on case studies from Norway, Sweden, and the U.S. using market data, vehicle registrations, and empirical evidence.

### 4. Carbon Credits and Carbon Neutralization  
**Funded by the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)**, this initiative develops a new financing system based on tradable carbon and equity credits. Travelers who shift to non-driving transportation modes can earn credits, which may be acquired by organizations working toward carbon neutrality.
