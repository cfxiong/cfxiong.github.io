I'm Ruohan Li, a first-year Ph.D student at the department of civil and engineering, Villanova University. My current research centers on the area of traffic data analyzing, machine learning, deep learning, automated driving, and transportation big data. Currently, I'm focusing on developing models for trajectory prediction to find more possibilities in population movement. More information and works can be find [here](https://ruohanlixyf.github.io/)!
