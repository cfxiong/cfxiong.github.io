My name is Kailun (Kevin) Liu, and I was a data scientist intern at TransFlow Solutions. I am an introductory-level data scientist and enjoy applying machine learning models and big data methods to multiple social science and economics projects. I graduated from Fordham University in 2020 with a master's degree in Business Analytics and Liberty University in 2018 with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics.
