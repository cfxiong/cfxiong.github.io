Greetings! I'm Weiyu Luo, a third-year Ph.D student at the department of civil and engineering, Villanova University. My supervisor is Prof. Chenfeng Xiong and I'm now working as a graduate assistant in his group. I'm dedicated in research of human mobility and travel behavior patterns, transportation safety risks and their mutual effects with public health, economy, government policy, etc., at both aggregated and individual levels. Specifically, my work is aiming at using the large-scale privacy-protected mobile device location data, geographical data, social structure data, etc., in tandem with statistical models, machine learning and artificial intelligence methods and distributed-computing techniques to find and interpret human mobility patterns and predict travel behavior at aggregated-level.
