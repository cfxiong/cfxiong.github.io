collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2018-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'This paper extends the dynamically formulated hidden Markov models to a high-order hidden Markov model (HO-HMM) formulation. In the HO-HMM, the Markovian assumption that the future states (interpreted as the states of preferences or attitudes) depend only on the current state has been relaxed. Instead, the HO-HMM generalizes that the future states will depend on a number of states occurring beforehand. '
